## Purpose behind the development

MoodApp was my first project built with React. It was an implementation of knowledge and skills I gained over few months while having a full-stack React course. Also, I had a belief this application would help individuals with mild mood disorders. Later I am still getting back to working on this project to improve it's code quality and ensure it has less vulnerabilities.
